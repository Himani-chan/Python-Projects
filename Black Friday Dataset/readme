Project Title: Black Friday Data Processing and Preprocessing

Description:

This project focuses on the analysis and preprocessing of the Black Friday dataset to prepare it for predictive modeling. Key steps include:

1) Data Integration: Combined training and test datasets for a unified analysis.
2) Feature Engineering: Created and transformed features (e.g., mapping categorical data to integers, generating dummy variables).
3) Missing Value Handling: Addressed missing values using techniques like mode and mean imputation.
4) Descriptive Statistics: Explored the data using summary statistics and unique value counts for better insights.
5) Data Cleaning: Dropped unnecessary columns and renamed features for consistency.
6) Label Encoding: Converted categorical variables to numerical using label encoding.
7) Correlation Analysis: Assessed relationships between features using correlation matrices.
8) Data Splitting and Scaling: Prepared data for machine learning by splitting into training and testing sets and scaling numerical features (not implemented in the final code).

Key Highlights:

1) Demonstrated robust preprocessing techniques for real-world datasets.
2) Combined categorical and numerical transformations to clean the data.
3) Leveraged Python's Pandas and Scikit-learn libraries for effective data handling and feature preparation.
