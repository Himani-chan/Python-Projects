Project Title: Titanic Data Manipulation with Pandas

Description:

This project demonstrates data manipulation and exploratory analysis techniques on the Titanic dataset using Python and the Pandas library. Key steps include:

 1) Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset (handling missing values, feature transformation, etc.).
 2) Generating descriptive statistics to gain insights into passenger demographics, survival rates, and other key metrics.
 3) Visualizing data trends and relationships using Python libraries.
 4) Leveraging Pandas for advanced filtering, grouping, and aggregation to uncover meaningful patterns.

Key Learnings:

 1) Practical use of Pandas for real-world data handling tasks.
 2) Strategies for data cleaning and preprocessing in machine learning workflows.
 3) Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract actionable insights
